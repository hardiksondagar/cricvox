All that cautious optimism of Indian fans can turn into unbridled, berserk celebrations as the Men in Blue conquer the summit that Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli and the rest set out to climb since 2013. The downbeat of Dhaka in 2014, the Sydney stumble of 2015, the Wankhede woes of 2016, the Oval obstacle of 2017, the Manchester mess up of 2019, the Adelaide avalanche of 2022 and the Ahmedabad anomaly of 2023, all forgotten in a jiffy as Team India finally break a 11-year jinx to call themselves champions again! A show of stellar dominance with a clear blueprint of intent, sprinkled with a selfless skipper and a talismanic bowling attack who can dig you out of hell or high water.

A good king, a strong king knows his value, knows when to strike and how to strike, and strikes in a manner to sting a lethal blow on the opponent while taking his kingdom along. For years now, King Kohli has been a cut above the rest for India in limited overs cricket, saving his kingdom plenty of times. <i>He isn’t just the guy who can play the shot of an emperor, he is the walking, talking emperor himself</i> and he deserves all of cricket’s riches and fame as he walks off into the sunset one last time in his T20I career holding onto that one ornament missing from his cherished cabinet…</div></div></div><div><div class="flex  mx-4 wb:mx-4 py-2 border-t border-dotted border-cbChineseSilver  wb:border-0"><div class="flex flex-col gap-2 items-center"><div class="font-bold text-center "></div></div><div>And a quick little footnote, let's also remember the outgoing coach <b>Rahul Dravid, </b>who just like the most of his playing career, stayed in the shadows, but had a telling impact on this bunch of boys. A key attribute of the Rohit-Rahul tenure has been backing their players, giving them a long rope and not chopping and changing. Arshdeep didn't have the best of IPL seasons but he was the designated new-ball bowler for India throughout. There were plenty of calls for Shivam Dube for his tepid performances in this World Cup, but he shone through with a handy cameo today. They backed their boys throughout the competition, and today it has paid dividends...</div></div></div><div><div class="flex  mx-4 wb:mx-4 py-2 border-t border-dotted border-cbChineseSilver  wb:border-0"><div class="flex flex-col gap-2 items-center"><div class="font-bold text-center "></div></div><div>Even the harshest of critics would find it difficult to say India don’t deserve this!! An invincible run to the trophy. They picked a team for the conditions, trusted their boys and it has paid off. <b>Rohit Sharma</b> led the way with his fearlessness and intent, <b>Suryakumar</b> showed his class in conditions that weren’t the easiest for his style of batting, <b>Dube</b> and <b>Axar</b> played handy cameos and <b>Virat </b>came to the party in this all important final. And what about the bowlers? It is true when they say batters win you a match, and bowlers win you a tournament. And <b>Jasprit Bumrah</b> alone probably wins you tournament(s). <b>Arshdeep</b> proved his mettle with the new ball, <b>Kuldeep</b> was the coveted wicket-taker throughout the Caribbean and <b>Axar</b> was at his frugal best for most of this tournament. And a moment to acknowledge <b>Hardik Pandya.</b> He was crucified throughout the IPL, villainized to an unsanitary level and today he will be deified as an Indian immortal.

And then he hoists the silverware high to the sky. The timid youngster of 2007 who was the side stringer back then is ready to take centrestage out here. Leading from the front with a focus on fearlessness and intent, Rohit Sharma is ready to now shake hands with his self-scripted destiny. From <b>'Mujhe sirf woh trophy dikhta hai' [Only the trophy is visible to my eyes]</b> to holding that beautiful piece of metal aloft, Rohit's life has come full circle… Jay Shah hands over the trophy to the Indian skipper, and his teammates circle around him as they take turns lifting the trophy. Kohli gets his hands on it and gestures towards Rahul Dravid to join the party. <i>The Indian coach hoists up that trophy and shakes it vigorously up and down with gritted teeth mouthing a come on, giving us one of the most animated poses anybody would have seen of him in all those years of his cricketing career.</i> The Indian players pose for team pictures and Kohli breaks out into a beaming smile. All happy faces now, the tears have been left behind, the sorrows have been left behind, it is now time to revel in the moment for the Men in Blue!!</div></div></div><div><div class="flex  mx-4 wb:mx-4 py-2 border-t border-dotted border-cbChineseSilver  wb:border-0"><div class="flex flex-col gap-2 items-center"><div class="font-bold text-center "></div></div><div><b>Rohit Sharma | India Captain:</b> Very hard to sum up what we have been through for the last 3-4 years. To be honest, we worked very hard as individuals and as a team a team, lot has gone on behind the scenes for us to be here today and win this game. It is not what we did today, it is what we have been doing for the last 3-4 years. That's the the result that has come for us today. We have played lots of high pressure games in the past as well and have been on the wrong side as well. But the guys understand what needs to be done. Today was the perfect example of when the back is against the wall, what is required. We stuck together as a team and the guys, all of us, even when at one point it was looking South Africa's way. Overall, as a team, as a group on the field, we wanted this really bad. We wanted to win this. To win a tournament like this, a lot goes behind the scenes, a lot of effort, a lot of minds need to come together. I am very proud of this bunch of boys I have and the management as well for giving us that liberty to go and play, to execute, for having that trust in each one of us. That has to start from the management, coach, captain and then the players go out there and do it. Throughout the tournament, I think we were fantastic. Not me and nobody was in doubt with Virat's form. We know the quality he has, he's been on top of his game for 15 years, come the occasion the big players will stand up. Virat was holding that one end which was very crucial for us and the others played around him. For us to get to that total, it was a team effort. We wanted someone to bat as long as possible. These are not wickets where you can come and bat freely and keep the scoreboard ticking straightaway, so we do understand that. We wanted somebody to bat as long as possible and Virat did that perfectly. That's where the experience of Virat comes through. The other guys around played really well, Axar's knock of 47 was very crucial as well. (On Bumrah) I can understand you guys trying to put it into words but I've been someone who has seen him for so many years, even playing alongside him, but even I don't what exactly is with him. I know exactly what he brings to the table but how he does that, it is just a masterclass. He backs his skills which is more than enough and he is a very confident lad. Whatever he wants to do, he executes to perfection which is a very rare sight. Jasprit Bumrah, to put it in one word, he's a class act. Hardik was brilliant as well, bowling that last over, no matter how many runs is required, to bowl that last over, I am very proud of the boys. Absolutely fantastic, all the way from New York to Barbados, I just want to salute them, to come and support us the way they have and even back home in India, millions are sitting and watching, it's late night in India, I'm pretty sure they are up watching this. They have been waiting a long time, just like us. This is for them. Very very proud of what we have achieved today.</div></div></div><div><div class="flex  mx-4 wb:mx-4 py-2 border-t border-dotted border-cbChineseSilver  wb:border-0"><div class="flex flex-col gap-2 items-center"><div class="font-bold text-center "></div></div><div>Now the Indian players walk up to collect their medals.</div></div></div><div><div class="flex  mx-4 wb:mx-4 py-2 border-t border-dotted border-cbChineseSilver  wb:border-0"><div class="flex flex-col gap-2 items-center"><div class="font-bold text-center "></div></div><div><b>Aiden Markram | South Africa Captain:</b> Gutted for the time being. It'll take some time for us to have a really good reflection on a really good campaign the group had. Obviously for the time being, like I mentioned, it hurts quite a bit. Having said that, I'm incredibly proud of this group of players and everyone involved with the team. I feel they bowled well (SA bowlers). Don't think there was a whole lot to work with with regards to the pitch. Thought they did well to restrict them to what we thought was a chaseable total. Thought we batted really well as well, and it came down to the wire. Really good game of cricket. We've seen with a lot of our games in this campaign - it's never over till the last ball is bowled. We never got comfortable, there's always an element of scoreboard pressure. And especially at the back end, things happen quite quickly and can turn quite quickly as well. Having said that, we got into a great position which proves we're worthy finalists. Could've won the game today. Unfortunately we didn't. Still, like I mentioned, incredibly proud of the group. Hopefully in a really good way (how does this set them up for the future?). One thing guaranteed about a South African wherever they are in the world is they're a really competitive person, really respectful person and a person that'll go down with a fight. Hopefully looking forward we can draw a lot from those few things and keep putting the skill side of the sport to good use. It's still a proud moment for us.</div></div></div><div><div class="flex  mx-4 wb:mx-4 py-2 border-t border-dotted border-cbChineseSilver  wb:border-0"><div class="flex flex-col gap-2 items-center"><div class="font-bold text-center "></div></div><div>The South African players come up to collect their runners-up medal.</div></div></div><div><div class="flex  mx-4 wb:mx-4 py-2 border-t border-dotted border-cbChineseSilver  wb:border-0"><div class="flex flex-col gap-2 items-center"><div class="font-bold text-center "></div></div><div>What about the reactions in the South African camp?

I don’t usually cry after a game but this feels really special. Midway stage we felt we were in trouble but to pull off a win like this is an unreal feeling. I'm just really over the moon. My son is here, my family is here and I could do something special for India. We've been working really hard towards this and we've come close and fell short last time but we were able to go through this time, there's no better feeling than that. You play the sport for this, for these days, for big stages when you do well and get your team through, there's no better feeling. (On his rhythm throughout the tournament) It just felt good, was trying to keep myself in a bubble because I was spending time with my family, not thinking too far ahead, staying where your feet are. All of these things are okay, yes we do say it but when it comes the big day, you have to do it even more. You have to do what you have been doing, not to try over because it's the final. So just felt really good and over the tournament I felt very clear and calm. (On the pressure while bowling the 16th over) I don't look at it like that, whenever I'm in my peak mindset I always think of one ball at a time and one over at a time, if I think of the overall picture too early, I give in to the pressure and I try too hard sometimes. This was what was working for me. Today yes, emotions can take over, it was taking over but you have to keep yourself in check but now the job is done, the emotions can come out and you can scream and shout. (Thoughts while bowling the 16th over) When it was a run-a-ball, we did think that what is happening, so when I came I saw the ball was a bit scuffed up and it would reverse a bit, so I thought what is the most difficult shot for the batsman, how will he get beaten or I will get a wicket and I thought length ball was an option as ball was reverse-swinging, I was happy that I was able to keep my calm and I was able to execute.</div></div></div><div><div class="flex  mx-4 wb:mx-4 py-2 border-t border-dotted border-cbChineseSilver  wb:border-0"><div class="flex flex-col gap-2 items-center"><div class="font-bold text-center "></div></div><div><b>Virat Kohli | Player of the Match:</b> Well, <b>this was my last T20 World Cup</b>.. And.. This is exactly what we wanted to achieve. This is an amazing game. I was telling Rohit today when we went out to bat I was like.. one day you feel like you can't get a run and then you come out and things happen. God is great. I bow my head in gratitude. I am really grateful that I was able to get the job done for the team on the day it mattered the most. (On his different approach today) Just the occasion. It was now or never I knew. This is.. <b>my last T20 game playing for India</b>. It's the last World Cup I was going to play, so I wanted to make the most of it and this was our aim. We wanted to win an ICC tournament. We wanted to lift the cup and as I said it was the occasion that helped me to put my head down and just respect the situation rather than trying to force things out there and really play the game that my team wanted me to play. (Have just you made an announcement about T20Is?) Yes I have. This was an open secret (smiles). It was not something that I was not going to announce even if we had lost. This was going to be my last T20 World Cup playing for India. It's time for the next generation to take over. It's a 2-year cycle and there are some amazing players playing in India and they are going to take the team forward in the T20 format and do wonders as we have seen them do in the IPL and I have no doubts that they will keep the flags waving high and take this team further from here now. It's been a long wait for us just waiting to win an ICC tournament. It's not just me alone. You look at someone like Rohit, he's played 9 T20 World Cups and this is my sixth. He deserves it as much as anyone else in the squad. Just happy we were able to get the job done and really it's hard to explain the emotions I felt after the game. I knew what kind of mindset I was in. I wasn't very confident in the last few games. I wasn't feeling really good out there. But when God has to bless you with something he shows in ways that you can't imagine and that's why I said I'm grateful and humbled right now and I bow my head. It's been difficult and hence the emotions of the game went as well and the way we came back and the kind of character the guys showed it's really difficult to hold things back. I think it's going to sink in a little later, the emotions are going to come to the surface a little later more but it's just an amazing day and I couldn't be more thankful.</div></div></div><div><div class="flex  mx-4 wb:mx-4 py-2 border-t border-dotted border-cbChineseSilver  wb:border-0"><div class="flex flex-col gap-2 items-center"><div class="font-bold text-center "></div></div><div><b>More celebration scenes:</b> Pandya is holding an Indian tri-colour flag in his hand as he speaks to Nasser Hussain. <i>Pandya whose equation with Rohit was the talk of the town for the last 6 months sees the Indian skipper come and give him a peck on the cheek</i>.

I was not thinking that this is the final, that worked for me when I went for batting because I wasn’t thinking ahead that if I got out, then what happens. Just played on merit. (On Rohit Sharma) He is an amazing man, he led Team India very good in this World Cup, and Rahul bhai gave everything to us so that we can enjoy it without putting pressure, just do our best. (On being promoted up the order) Not today, I thought I was going down the order but when we lost 3 wickets early, Rahul bhai told me that Axar, please pad up. I didn’t get a lot of time to think about my batting and that worked for me.</div></div></div><div class="my-2 mx-4 wb:mx-3"><div class="flex justify-center"><div class="w-full "><a title="[object Object]" href="/cricket-videos/100169/cricbuzz-live-hindi-t20-world-cup-final-south-africa-v-india-post-match-show" class="block pointer-events-auto"><div class=" flex flex-col w-full rounded-md overflow-hidden dark:bg-cbItmBkgDark border border-gray-200 shadow-sm transition-all duration-300 ease-in-out hover:scale-[1.02] hover:shadow-md hover:bg-[rgba(0,0,0,0.01)] "><div class="relative"><div class="w-full"><img alt="cricbuzz-live-hindi-t20-world-cup-final-south-africa-v-india-post-match-show" loading="lazy" width="540" height="303" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" class="w-full h-auto object-cover rounded-t-md" srcset="https://static.cricbuzz.com/a/img/v1/i1/c509584/cricbuzz-live-hindi-t20-world-cup-final-south-africa-v-india-post-match-show.jpg?d=high&amp;p=det 1x, https://static.cricbuzz.com/a/img/v1/i1/c509584/cricbuzz-live-hindi-t20-world-cup-final-south-africa-v-india-post-match-show.jpg?d=high&amp;p=det 2x" src="https://static.cricbuzz.com/a/img/v1/i1/c509584/cricbuzz-live-hindi-t20-world-cup-final-south-africa-v-india-post-match-show.jpg?d=high&amp;p=det" style="color: transparent; width: 100%; height: auto;"></div><div class="absolute top-1/2 left-1/2 -translate-x-1/2 -translate-y-1/2 w-9 h-9 rounded-full flex items-center justify-center text-white text-base pointer-events-none bg-[rgba(0,0,0,0.55)] "><span class="cbPlusIco cbPlayIcon transform scale-75"></span></div></div><div class="bg-white rounded-b-md p-2 border-t border-gray-300 transition-colors duration-200 h-[56px] content-center"><h4 class="text-black text-sm font-normal overflow-hidden text-ellipsis line-clamp-2"><div>Cricbuzz Live Hindi: T20 World Cup, Final | South Africa v India, Post-match Show</div></h4><div class="flex items-center gap-1 mt-1"></div></div></div></a></div></div></div><div><div class="flex  mx-4 wb:mx-4 py-2 border-t border-dotted border-cbChineseSilver  wb:border-0"><div class="flex flex-col gap-2 items-center"><div class="font-bold text-center "></div></div><div><b>Hardik Pandya: </b>It means a lot. Very emotional, we’ve been working very hard but something was not clicking but today was the day we fulfilled what the whole nation wanted. More special for me, how my last 6 months were, I have been very graceful of not speaking a word, things have been very unfair but I believed that if I keep working hard there will be a time where I would shine and do what I could do. That sums everything up. It was a dream to win. Getting an opportunity like this makes it even more special. We always believed we can do it, it was just about executing our plans and staying calm and let the pressure come to them. Credit to Jassi (Bumrah) and the fast bowlers for the way they bowled those last 4 overs. Changed everything and it was about time to get it. Knew if I was not going to be calm it would not help me execute my plans and make sure every ball I bowled I commit 100%. So yes, I've been in this situation, I've not won it but for me, I’ve always enjoyed pressure situations. All of a sudden my run-up speed increased as well when the time came, it's been wonderful. Very happy for him (Dravid), he’s been a wonderful man, really enjoyed working with him, to give him a farewell like, this is how his coaching career ends, this is wonderful, have had a very good relationship with him and became friends. Very excited, very happy for him. Very happy for all the support staff. <b>(Rohit walks over and gives Pandya a kiss).</b></div></div></div><div><div class="flex  mx-4 wb:mx-4 py-2 border-t border-dotted border-cbChineseSilver  wb:border-0"><div class="flex flex-col gap-2 items-center"><div class="font-bold text-center "></div></div><div><b>Mohammed Siraj:</b> My only belief was on Jassy (Bumrah) bhai (To turn this game around). He's the only game-changer. Whatever I thought exactly happened. Unbelievable feeling guys, can't explain. Last World Cup I (we) lost the final.

At that stage, South Africa needed 26 off 24 and crucially there was a break in play with Pant receiving attention. That break potentially disrupted South Africa and Klaasen fell next ball, from there, India turned it around dramatically to win from nowhere. Coming back to Pandya, the tears at the end when he sobbed so much showed how much this meant to him. Maybe it was written in the stars that he had to do it for India after all the stuff he had to go through in the last 6 months. He has kept a dignified silence all through that period when it wouldn't have been easy at all. Lesser mortals would have succumbed. Not Hardik. Today is about life coming full circle for him. And then the tears did not stop. Fitting finale for a man who has come clutch at the right time when India needed it most.</div></div></div><div><div class="flex  mx-4 wb:mx-4 py-2 border-t border-dotted border-cbChineseSilver  wb:border-0"><div class="flex flex-col gap-2 items-center"><div class="font-bold text-center "></div></div><div><b>What happened after the last ball when India were confirmed as champs:</b> Arshdeep rolled the ball back to the bowler from deep mid-wicket. Pandya fell down to the turf and is seen sobbing uncontrollably like a child. Rohit went flat on his back - head down, slapped his hands on the turf 4-5 times and is seen shaking his head after he gets up. A tear or two from the Indian captain too. The Indian support staff run all the way to the players to hug and celebrate. Dravid envelops Kohli in a hug, the latter visibly relieved, did he too shed a tear or two? Meanwhile in the South African camp it's opposite reactions - Miller is near the LED boundary hoardings head down unable to believe what has just happened. With India still celebrating and with South Africa coming out, waiting to shake hands, Rohit asks his players to come down for those rituals. Siraj is crying his eyes out too. Rohit hugs Kohli with both emotional. Rohit then folds his hands and does a namaskar to presumably someone up above. What scenes. This is what elite sport is all about.</div></div></div><div><div class="flex  mx-4 wb:mx-4 py-2 border-t border-dotted border-cbChineseSilver  wb:border-0"><div class="flex flex-col gap-2 items-center"><div class="font-bold text-center "></div></div><div>Now to the game. India managed to get 176 runs on the board as Virat Kohli scored his first fifty of the tournament. He anchored through after Rohit and Rishabh were put early, and many might have questioned his intent had the result gone the other way, but for now it will be celebrated as a master knock by the man who knows exactly how to accelerate in this format. Shivam Dube and Axar Patel got handy contributions for India too. In reply, Hendricks was knocked over by a superb Bumrah outswinger and Markram fell cheaply as well. However, Stubbs played well against the spinners and got South Africa in the ascendancy after the powerplay. He was dismissed but de Kock and Klaasen stitched together a partnership. Klaasen was in a murderous mood as he got to a 23-ball fifty, and took down Axar for a 24-run over. The equation was down to 30 off the last five overs, but India's pacers managed to pull a real rabbit out of the bag. Hardik got Klaasen, then Bumrah knocked over Jansen as South Africa felt the pressure. Arshdeep then bowled a brilliant penultimate over, conceding just 4 and Hardik Pandya bowled like a champion to close out the game and give India a win by 7 runs. Lots of presentations and interviews lined up, hang around...</div></div></div><div><div class="flex  mx-4 wb:mx-4 py-2 border-t border-dotted border-cbChineseSilver  wb:border-0"><div class="flex flex-col gap-2 items-center"><div class="font-bold text-center "></div></div><div><b>14:04 Local Time, 18:04 GMT, 23:34 IST:</b> Rohit Sharma walks away from the crowd to have a moment with himself.

A teardrop trickles down Virat Kohli's eyes too, he's chased after this trophy since 2009, and finally he can get his hands on it probably in the twilight of his T20I career.

Maharaj rocked them early, getting rid of Rohit and Pant in the second over, and the hole got deeper when Rabada removed Surya cheaply as well. However, Kohli dropped anchor and was helped in a big way by Axar Patel who did most of the heavy lifting after being promoted up the order to lead the recovery for India. Axar's superb 47, and a late flourish from both Kohli and Dube - the two players have struggled all tournament - have taken them to a strong total here in Barbados. Marco Jansen had an off day for South Africa, giving away 49 off his four overs. There is grip for spinners on this pitch, and India will fancy their chances.

The boundaries are relatively shorter here and if India can get to somewhere around 180, they'll feel like they're in the driver's seat.

The first powerplay will be extremely crucial and it'll set the tone for the rest of the game.

Different individuals have stepped up at different times and that's what we're looking forward to today as well. <b>Same team.</b></div></div></div><div><div class="flex  mx-4 wb:mx-4 py-2 border-t border-dotted border-cbChineseSilver  wb:border-0"><div class="flex flex-col gap-2 items-center"><div class="font-bold text-center "></div></div><div><b>India have won the toss and have opted to bat</b></div></div></div><div class="my-2 mx-4 wb:mx-3"><div class="flex justify-center"><div class="w-full "><a title="[object Object]" href="/cricket-videos/100102/cricbuzz-live-t20-world-cup-final-south-africa-v-india-pre-match-show" class="block pointer-events-auto"><div class=" flex flex-col w-full rounded-md overflow-hidden dark:bg-cbItmBkgDark border border-gray-200 shadow-sm transition-all duration-300 ease-in-out hover:scale-[1.02] hover:shadow-md hover:bg-[rgba(0,0,0,0.01)] "><div class="relative"><div class="w-full"><img alt="cricbuzz-live-t20-world-cup-final-south-africa-v-india-pre-match-show" loading="lazy" width="540" height="303" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" class="w-full h-auto object-cover rounded-t-md" srcset="https://static.cricbuzz.com/a/img/v1/i1/c509174/cricbuzz-live-t20-world-cup-final-south-africa-v-india-pre-match-show.jpg?d=high&amp;p=det 1x, https://static.cricbuzz.com/a/img/v1/i1/c509174/cricbuzz-live-t20-world-cup-final-south-africa-v-india-pre-match-show.jpg?d=high&amp;p=det 2x" src="https://static.cricbuzz.com/a/img/v1/i1/c509174/cricbuzz-live-t20-world-cup-final-south-africa-v-india-pre-match-show.jpg?d=high&amp;p=det" style="color: transparent; width: 100%; height: auto;"></div><div class="absolute top-1/2 left-1/2 -translate-x-1/2 -translate-y-1/2 w-9 h-9 rounded-full flex items-center justify-center text-white text-base pointer-events-none bg-[rgba(0,0,0,0.55)] "><span class="cbPlusIco cbPlayIcon transform scale-75"></span></div></div><div class="bg-white rounded-b-md p-2 border-t border-gray-300 transition-colors duration-200 h-[56px] content-center"><h4 class="text-black text-sm font-normal overflow-hidden text-ellipsis line-clamp-2"><div>Cricbuzz Live: T20 World Cup, Final | South Africa v India, Pre-match show</div></h4><div class="flex items-center gap-1 mt-1"></div></div></div></a></div></div></div><div><div class="flex  mx-4 wb:mx-4 py-2 border-t border-dotted border-cbChineseSilver  wb:border-0"><div class="flex flex-col gap-2 items-center"><div class="font-bold text-center "></div></div><div><b>Pitch report | Ian Bishop &amp; Nasser Hussain:</b> Hope the weather gods are shining on us. There is a 30% chance of rain and a strong wind blowing towards fine-leg for the left-hander and that’s the shortest boundary at 56m. Don’t be surprised if Quinton de Kock targets that boundary or Suryakumar Yadav tries to open up his body. It is a central pitch so fairly even boundaries on all sides. Interesting looking surface, it is hard but there is no live grass. Fairly hard surface so hoping the ball comes onto the bat nicely. More wickets have fallen to pacers here, so that might indicate some bounce. Won’t be surprised if there are some footmarks as the game goes on. There isn’t an extreme amount of bounce, but if you work hard you can make cross-batted shots difficult. A pretty fair pitch, doesn’t have the bounce of St Lucia or the low bounce of Guyana. We reckon it will be an even contest.</div></div></div><div><div class="flex  mx-4 wb:mx-4 py-2 border-t border-dotted border-cbChineseSilver  wb:border-0"><div class="flex flex-col gap-2 items-center"><div class="font-bold text-center "></div></div><div>For South Africa, Quinton de Kock has found some form at the right time. While his partner has struggled for runs, de Kock has been fearless with his strokeplay and has given his team some great starts. It's the middle-order that's really been under the scanner all tournament long and it starts with Markram himself. They've been short of runs and they simply cannot afford to falter once more today. While the batters have struggled, the bowlers have picked up the slack. Maharaj and Shamsi have been great as spinners while Jansen, Rabada and Nortje have been ruthless as well.</div></div></div><div><div class="flex  mx-4 wb:mx-4 py-2 border-t border-dotted border-cbChineseSilver  wb:border-0"><div class="flex flex-col gap-2 items-center"><div class="font-bold text-center "></div></div><div>That brings us back here to the final. Both the semi-finals were non-contests, affirming once more that the two best sides of the tournament - who're also both unbeaten, something that's happened for the first time in a World Cup - are here to battle it out and see which team is really the best. India will stick to their guns just like they have all tournament long. The only change they made to their team was to unleash their three-prong spin-attack once they landed in the Caribbean. Rohit Sharma has looked in great touch at the top of the order and the fact that Virat Kohli is due for runs makes the opening pair even scarier. Pant and SKY have been at their dynamic best in the middle-order while Pandya and Dube have added the muscle. Then there's the three left-arm spinners who've been superb along with Arshdeep who's been fantastic in the powerplay and Bumrah who's simply a class apart.</div></div></div><div><div class="flex  mx-4 wb:mx-4 py-2 border-t border-dotted border-cbChineseSilver  wb:border-0"><div class="flex flex-col gap-2 items-center"><div class="font-bold text-center "></div></div><div><b>The same, however, cannot be said for South Africa.</b> Their batting order faced a continued struggle on the surfaces in the USA. While they battled to put up competitive totals, their fiery bowling attack bailed them out. The Netherlands, Bangladesh and Nepal all ran South Africa really close in the group-stage. The game against Nepal, in particular, was an extremely tight finish and the result could've easily been different had Nepal managed to hold their nerve. And that's exactly what South Africa have managed to do so well this competition - hold their nerve. After beating USA and England by very close margins in the Super 8s, they faced the West Indies in what was a virtual knockout and once more, they held their nerve in the face of tremendous pressure. Then there was the semi-final against Afghanistan - their best win of the competition yet where they completely blew the opposition away.</div></div></div><div><div class="flex  mx-4 wb:mx-4 py-2 border-t border-dotted border-cbChineseSilver  wb:border-0"><div class="flex flex-col gap-2 items-center"><div class="font-bold text-center "></div></div><div><b>So, what's India's road to the final been like?</b> They've been nearly faultless. They registered three clinical wins against Ireland, Pakistan and the USA in the group stage and brushed aside Afghanistan and Bangladesh in their first two Super 8 games. Facing their nemesis Australia next, India put some demons to bed and registered another convincing win to make it into the semi-finals unbeaten. England were next on the menu and India continued their feast. Skipper Rohit Sharma led the batting effort as India posted 171 on a tacky surface before Axar Patel and Kuldeep Yadav ran through the English batting order to hand India a 68-run win. 5 of India's 7 wins have come while batting first and they've all been extremely convincing, perhaps apart from the game against Pakistan which went down to the wire. In other words, they're yet to face an opponent who's truly given them a run for their money.</div></div></div><div><div class="flex  mx-4 wb:mx-4 py-2 border-t border-dotted border-cbChineseSilver  wb:border-0"><div class="flex flex-col gap-2 items-center"><div class="font-bold text-center "></div></div><div>As cliched as it may sound, today's game as much a mental battle as it is a battle of skill. While playing in a World Cup final inevitably implies pressure, it'll be accentuated greatly by the weight of expectations on both teams. And the fact that both teams carry the label of 'chokers' to varying degrees won't make things any easier. As much as players speak about keeping the 'outside noise out' and about 'controlling the controllables', they'll be very aware of the implications and expectations. The real challenge then is to turn up and still be at your best, to still perform and remain unfazed knowing full well the disappointment that will follow if you don't. Succumbing to the pressure and facing heartbreak in World Cup knockouts isn't new for both these sides but that won't make digesting another one any easier - in fact, it'll only make it harder. That's really what's at stake, it's more than just a T20 World Cup trophy, much more.</div></div></div><div><div class="flex  mx-4 wb:mx-4 py-2 border-t border-dotted border-cbChineseSilver  wb:border-0"><div class="flex flex-col gap-2 items-center"><div class="font-bold text-center "></div></div><div><b>09:00 Local Time, 13:00 GMT, 18:30 IST:</b> The Kensington Oval will be abuzz with excitement as a 29-day and 54-match competition culminates here today with the final. The loudest cheers, however, will ring some 14,000km in India as they eagerly await to see their heroes finally get their hands on the silverware. India have been in the final of an ICC event twice in the last 12 months and here they are once more to try and end that 11-year trophy drought. If 11-years feels like a long time, then you must only look across to the opposition - South Africa - who've been waiting for their trophy much longer, thrice as long in fact. While cricket might not be the number 1 sport of choice in South Africa, this team will carry the hopes of the entire South African cricketing fraternity. A win today will be celebrated not just by this team but by all those who've donned the Proteas' jersey.</div></div></div><div class="my-2 mx-4 wb:mx-3"><a href="https://www.cricbuzz.com/cricket-news/130896/south-africa-vs-india-a-tactical-preview-of-the-grand-finale" class="flex gap-2 items-center bg-cbLightGrayish p-2 rounded-lg"><div class="w-1/2"><img alt="south-africa-vs-india-a-tactical-preview-of-the-grand-finale" loading="lazy" width="360" height="202" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="https://static.cricbuzz.com/a/img/v1/i1/c509152/south-africa-vs-india-a-tactical-preview-of-the-grand-finale.jpg?d=low&amp;p=det 1x, https://static.cricbuzz.com/a/img/v1/i1/c509152/south-africa-vs-india-a-tactical-preview-of-the-grand-finale.jpg?d=high&amp;p=det 2x" src="https://static.cricbuzz.com/a/img/v1/i1/c509152/south-africa-vs-india-a-tactical-preview-of-the-grand-finale.jpg?d=high&amp;p=det" style="color: transparent; width: 100%; height: auto; background-size: cover; background-position: 50% 50%; background-repeat: no-repeat; background-image: url(&quot;data:image/svg+xml;charset=utf-8,%3Csvg xmlns='http%3A//www.w3.org/2000/svg' viewBox='0 0 360 202'%3E%3Cfilter id='b' color-interpolation-filters='sRGB'%3E%3CfeGaussianBlur stdDeviation='20'/%3E%3C/filter%3E%3Cimage preserveAspectRatio='none' filter='url(%23b)' x='0' y='0' height='100%25' width='100%25' href='data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAYAAAAfFcSJAAAAAXNSR0IArs4c6QAAAAtJREFUGFdjYAACAAAFAAGq1chRAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC'/%3E%3C/svg%3E&quot;);"></div><div class="flex flex-col gap-2 wb:gap-8 w-full"><div class="text-cbTextLink text-sm">South Africa vs India - A tactical preview of the grand finale</div><div class="text-xs wb:text-sm text-ellipsis cbTxtElps2Lin overflow-hidden">All the data-driven sub-plots that you need to know ahead of the summit clash</div></div></a></div><div class="my-2 mx-4 wb:mx-3"><div class="flex justify-center"><div class="w-full "><a title="[object Object]" href="/cricket-videos/100096/t20-world-cup-final-south-africa-v-india-preview" class="block pointer-events-auto"><div class=" flex flex-col w-full rounded-md overflow-hidden dark:bg-cbItmBkgDark border border-gray-200 shadow-sm transition-all duration-300 ease-in-out hover:scale-[1.02] hover:shadow-md hover:bg-[rgba(0,0,0,0.01)] "><div class="relative"><div class="w-full"><img alt="t20-world-cup-final-south-africa-v-india-preview" loading="lazy" width="540" height="303" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" class="w-full h-auto object-cover rounded-t-md" srcset="https://static.cricbuzz.com/a/img/v1/i1/c509119/t20-world-cup-final-south-africa-v-india-preview.jpg?d=high&amp;p=det 1x, https://static.cricbuzz.com/a/img/v1/i1/c509119/t20-world-cup-final-south-africa-v-india-preview.jpg?d=high&amp;p=det 2x" src="https://static.cricbuzz.com/a/img/v1/i1/c509119/t20-world-cup-final-south-africa-v-india-preview.jpg?d=high&amp;p=det" style="color: transparent; width: 100%; height: auto; background-size: cover; background-position: 50% 50%; background-repeat: no-repeat; background-image: url(&quot;data:image/svg+xml;charset=utf-8,%3Csvg xmlns='http%3A//www.w3.org/2000/svg' viewBox='0 0 540 303'%3E%3Cfilter id='b' color-interpolation-filters='sRGB'%3E%3CfeGaussianBlur stdDeviation='20'/%3E%3C/filter%3E%3Cimage preserveAspectRatio='none' filter='url(%23b)' x='0' y='0' height='100%25' width='100%25' href='data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAYAAAAfFcSJAAAAAXNSR0IArs4c6QAAAAtJREFUGFdjYAACAAAFAAGq1chRAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC'/%3E%3C/svg%3E&quot;);"></div><div class="absolute top-1/2 left-1/2 -translate-x-1/2 -translate-y-1/2 w-9 h-9 rounded-full flex items-center justify-center text-white text-base pointer-events-none bg-[rgba(0,0,0,0.55)] "><span class="cbPlusIco cbPlayIcon transform scale-75"></span></div></div><div class="bg-white rounded-b-md p-2 border-t border-gray-300 transition-colors duration-200 h-[56px] content-center"><h4 class="text-black text-sm font-normal overflow-hidden text-ellipsis line-clamp-2"><div>T20 World Cup, Final | South Africa v India: Preview</div></h4><div class="flex items-center gap-1 mt-1"></div></div></div></a></div></div></div><div><div class="flex  mx-4 wb:mx-4 py-2 border-t border-dotted border-cbChineseSilver  wb:border-0"><div class="flex flex-col gap-2 items-center"><div class="font-bold text-center "></div></div><div><b>Preview by Vijay Tagore </b>     <br>  <br>In just about a year, the <b>Rahul Dravid-Rohit Sharma</b> combination will be heading into their third final, raising the big question: will the third attempt be the triumphant one? After the loss in the WTC final last June and the heartbreaking World Cup defeat at home last November - both against Australia incidentally - India are determined to set the record straight as they face South Africa in the Twenty20 World Cup final on Saturday. But can they?     <br>     <br>"Yes of course," said <b>Rahul Dravid</b>, on the eve of the match. "I think it's good that we are consistent and playing good cricket. For many years, especially in the last year, being No 1 in all three formats, playing in the finals.., is a good thing. Indian cricket has shown a lot of consistency and it is a very happy thing. And... if we play well and if we have the rub of the green, then we will win." The best part of the coach's response was that the Indian team isn't putting pressure on themselves, something they may have been guilty of on earlier two occasions, particularly last in the World Cup, to win the trophy. They are in a "life goes on" mode, blissfully unfazed about the 'what-if' factor.     <br>     <br>The pressure aside, South Africa will be formidable opponents, and India will need to be at the top of their game. Before the match, the think tank must make several crucial calls: Would they be happy with South Africa chasing or bat first? And what should India do themselves? Considering they have batted first in both crucial games against Australia and England, would it be wise to stick with this strategy, or should they assess the pitch and decide if it favors an easier chase, as they often do in the IPL? Finally, will the pressure of the final be too overwhelming, prompting them to stick with what has been working so far?     <br>     <br><b>Jos Buttler</b> provided a peek at what is expected in the final. "I think the two top sides in the final and it is going to be a game of small margins and it's going to be a great game. Two really good teams," the England skipper said after his team's semifinal loss to India in Georgetown on Thursday.     <br>     <br>Selection seems easy as they have been very clear on roles and aimed to give each player maximum chance to prove themselves, a bit like the Chennai Super Kings formula, which means <b>Virat Kohli and Shivam Dube</b>, despite their underwhelming showing so far, are likely to be persisted with. Who's to argue against that anyway, when there is success to show?     <br>     <br>The threat for India lies in South Africa's formidable batting lineup, which becomes even more dangerous on a good pitch with smaller boundary dimensions - a factor that could diminish the effectiveness of spinners. <b>Heinrich Klaasen and David Miller</b> are dangerous finishers who can apply strong pressure on the bowlers in the latter half of the innings. <b>Quinton de Kock</b>, who can dominate from the start, poses a challenge upfront as he showed against England in a league game.     <br>     <br>Regarding the South Africa bowling, much will depend on how effectively India pairs <b>Rishabh Pant and Shivam Dube</b> against <b>Keshav Maharaj and Tabraiz Shamsi</b>. The challenge arises if Pant gets out early, which has been happening of late. <b>Suryakumar Yadav and Hardik Pandya</b> cannot be delayed in the batting order, which will leave India needing to find a way to involve <b>Dube</b> early to handle the spinners without taking too many balls away.     <br>     <br>The pitch for the final (Pitch No. 4) has seen two previous games: England vs. Scotland, which was washed out, and Namibia vs. Oman, which went to a Super Over after a low-scoring affair. There's limited information that can be drawn from these matches, especially on a smaller ground. This raises the obvious question: Can Indian spinners handle the conditions? Having been accustomed to playing on smaller grounds in the IPL, they should be. But then this is a World Cup final. Another point of note is how Indian batsmen handle their fast bowlers and how can they pair up their left-handers to take on the South African spinners?     <br>     <br>But <b>Dravid</b> said they will try to control the controllables. "It's just about all the guys getting into ensuring that physically, mentally, tactically we are ready for the game. Those are the things that we can control - that we are fresh, that we have looked after all our niggles if there are any, we have done all our tactical preparation and they are mentally relaxed and excited and looking forward to the game," the coach, who will exit the Indian team after the final, said in a tone of pragmatism that has been a hallmark of his tenure.     <br>     <br><b>When:</b> Saturday, June 29 2024 at 20:00 IST, 10:00 Local Time     <br>     <br><b>Where:</b> Kensginton Oval, Bridgetown, Barbados     <br>     <br><b>Teams watch</b>     <br>     <br><b>India</b>     <br>     <br><b>Tactics &amp; matchups:</b> Pacers have had more success than spinners in Barbados in this World Cup but India are unlikely to tinker with their three-prong spin attack. Left-arm orthodox of <b>Axar Patel and Ravindra Jadeja</b> might prove useful against <b>Quinton de Kock and Aiden Markram</b>, who have been dismissed by this bowling variety seven times combined in T20Is since 2022. <b>Kuldeep</b> has also had success against <b>de Kock in T20s</b>, having dismissed him twice in 20 deliveries. <b>Arshdeep Singh</b> matches up well against the opener as well, with three dismissals in 32 deliveries for only 31 runs. <b>Hardik Pandya</b> has had success against his former Gujarat Titans teammate <b>David Miller</b>, having accounted for his wicket four times.     <br>     <br><b>Probable XI:</b> Rohit Sharma (c), Virat Kohli, Rishabh Pant (wk), Suryakumar Yadav, Shivam Dube, Hardik Pandya, Ravindra Jadeja, Axar Patel, Kuldeep Yadav, Arshdeep Singh, Jasprit Bumrah     <br>     <br><b>South Africa</b>     <br>     <br><b>Tactics &amp; matchups:</b> <b>Kagiso Rabada</b>, South Africa's premier pacer, will be key up front for the first-time finalists as he has accounted for <b>Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli</b> four times each in T20s, with the two openers having strike rates of 118.42 and 106.25 respectively against him. <b>Rabada</b> has also dismissed <b>Suryakumar Yadav</b> three times but has gone for 126 runs in 68 balls (batting SR of 185.29). <b>Anrich Nortje</b> has bowled well against <b>Kohli</b>, dismissing him three times in 33 balls for only 35 runs. <b>Keshav Maharaj</b> could prove useful against <b>Rishabh Pant</b>, having dismissed him twice in eight balls.     <br>     <br><b>Probable XI:</b> Quinton de Kock (wk), Reeza Hendricks, Aiden Markram (c), Heinrich Klaasen, David Miller, Tristan Stubbs, Marco Jansen, Keshav Maharaj, Kagiso Rabada, Anrich Nortje, Tabraiz Shamsi     <br>     <br><b>Did you know?</b>     <br>     <br>- This is the first instance of two unbeaten teams facing off in a T20 World Cup final. The last instance of a team having an unbeaten run throughout a Men's ICC tournament was the Champions Trophy in 2013 which India won     <br>     <br>- This is the third ICC tournament final for India under <b>Rohit Sharma</b> in a little over 12 months - in three different formats. He could also become the first to 50 wins as a T20I captain     <br>     <br>- <b>Aiden Markram</b> has a 100 percent success rate as a captain in ICC tournaments. Under his captaincy South Africa won six out of six in the Under 19 World Cup in 2014, he led them to two wins in the 2023 World Cup standing in for <b>Temba Bavuma</b>, and the unbeaten run in the 2024 T20 World Cup     <br>     <br>- The last time India and South Africa met in a knockout game in an ICC tournament was the T20 World Cup 2014 semi-final in Mirpur. <b>Virat Kohli</b> struck an unbeaten 72 off 44 balls to guide India to a six-wicket win in that game.     <br>     <br><b>What they said:</b>     <br>     <br>"I think what's really important and I think what we've done really well as a group, I think in this whole tournament, is we have shown the ability to adapt, to recognize what is a good score. We played very differently in New York, than we played at St. Lucia. Then we played even in Barbados in the first game and I thought that the wicket was quite slow. But again, for a final, we are not really sure what we are going to come up against. And I'm just hoping that whatever we come up against, we will have the ability to recognize it and to be able to play accordingly, as we've done in the last three games" - <b>Rahul Dravid, India head coach</b>.     <br>     <br>"We've been doing it for most of our careers, you jump from venue to venue where conditions are quite different. So, it's again just adapting to whatever is in front of you and playing the pitch and the game that's in front of you. We'll try to find ways to always take wickets with the ball and from a batting point of view try to get to a score that's defendable. So yeah, not looking too much into conditions. Both teams have to play on the same wicket. And ultimately, if you can develop some plans and come up with some plans on the day that can give you a good chance to win, then hopefully it works out that way" - <b>Aiden Markram, South Africa captain.</b></div></div></div><div><div class="flex  mx-4 wb:mx-4 py-2 border-t border-dotted border-cbChineseSilver  wb:border-0"><div class="flex flex-col gap-2 items-center"><div class="font-bold text-center "></div></div><div><b>Squads:</b></div></div></div><div><div class="flex  mx-4 wb:mx-4 py-2 border-t border-dotted border-cbChineseSilver  wb:border-0"><div class="flex flex-col gap-2 items-center"><div class="font-bold text-center "></div></div><div><b>India</b> Squad: Rohit Sharma(c), Virat Kohli, Rishabh Pant(w), Suryakumar Yadav, Hardik Pandya, Ravindra Jadeja, Shivam Dube, Axar Patel, Arshdeep Singh, Kuldeep Yadav, Jasprit Bumrah, Yuzvendra Chahal, Sanju Samson, Mohammed Siraj, Yashasvi Jaiswal</div></div></div><div><div class="flex  mx-4 wb:mx-4 py-2 border-t border-dotted border-cbChineseSilver  wb:border-0"><div class="flex flex-col gap-2 items-center"><div class="font-bold text-center "></div></div><div><b>South Africa</b> Squad: Quinton de Kock(w), Reeza Hendricks, Aiden Markram(c), Tristan Stubbs, Heinrich Klaasen, David Miller, Marco Jansen, Keshav Maharaj, Kagiso Rabada, Anrich Nortje, Tabraiz Shamsi, Ottneil Baartman, Gerald Coetzee, Bjorn Fortuin, Ryan Rickelton</div></div></div><div></div></div>
